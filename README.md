# RustUX
This is the primary launcher file: meaning this is what you would execute to start the server. The primary goal of this project is to introduce a declarative system that leaves the important configurations hyper-accessible, while fully autonomously managing the server binaries. In fact, you can fully delete the ./wrapped folder without losing any data whatsoever. (this is not true as of now map saves are stored in the rust folder but in between wipes ig you could lol) symlinks?

copy pasted from the launcher file lol i wrote it when i was bored
